# Tone_Recognition
This notebook demonstrates a Mandarin tone recognition algorithm that takes audio recordings of Chinese words from wiktionary. The resulting classifier should be able to recognize the spoken tone from a user's audio input.

This project is related to the CNN and RNN. Here CNN receives images of fixed size and outputs a predicted class label for each image along with a confidence level. In RNNs, the size of the input and the resulting output can vary.
